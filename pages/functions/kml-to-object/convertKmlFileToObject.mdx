# Function convertKmlFileToObject()

The `convertKmlFileToObject()` function is used to convert a KML file to a KML object.

## Syntax

```js filename="convertKmlFileToObject.js" copy
convertKmlFileToObject(file: string): Promise<KMLObject>
```

### Parameters

- `file` - The path to the KML file to convert.

### Returns

A `Promise` that resolves to a `KMLObject` representing the KML file.

## Example

```js filename="example.js" copy
import { convertKmlFileToObject } from '@trytech/kml';

const file = 'path/to/file.kml';

convertKmlFileToObject(file)
    .then(kmlObject => {

        console.log(kmlObject);
    })
    .catch(error => {

        console.error(error);
    });
```

In the example above, the `convertKmlFileToObject()` function is used to convert a KML file to a KML object. The `file` variable contains the path to the KML file to convert. The function returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `KMLObject` representing the KML file.

If the conversion is successful, the `kmlObject` variable will contain the KML object. Otherwise, an error will be thrown.

## Notes

- The `convertKmlFileToObject()` function is an asynchronous operation that returns a `Promise`. You can use the `then()` method to handle the resolved value (KML object) and the `catch()` method to handle any errors that occur during the conversion process.

- The `file` parameter should be a valid path to a KML file that you want to convert to a KML object.

- The `KMLObject` type represents a KML object that can be manipulated using other functions provided by the `@trytech/kml` package.
