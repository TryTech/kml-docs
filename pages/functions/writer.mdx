# Function writer()

The `writer()` function is used to write a KML object to a file.

## Syntax

```js filename="writer.js" copy
writer(kmlObject: KMLObject, filePath: string): Promise<void>
```

### Parameters

- `kmlObject` - The KML object to write to the file.

- `filePath` - The path to the output KML file.

### Returns

A `Promise` that resolves when the KML object is successfully written to the file.


## Example

```js filename="example.js" copy

import { writer } from '@trytech/kml';

const kmlObject = {
    document: {
        name: 'My KML Document',
        description: 'This is a sample KML document',
        placemarks: [
            {
                name: 'Placemark 1',
                description: 'This is Placemark 1',
                point: {
                    coordinates: '10,20,0'
                }
            },
            {
                name: 'Placemark 2',
                description: 'This is Placemark 2',
                point: {
                    coordinates: '30,40,0'
                }
            }
        ]
    }
};

writer(kmlObject, 'output.kml')
    .then(() => {
        console.log('KML file written successfully');
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

In the example above, the `writer()` function is used to write a KML object to a file named `output.kml`. The `kmlObject` object contains a sample KML document with two placemarks. The function returns a `Promise` that resolves when the KML object is successfully written to the file.

If an error occurs during the writing process, the `catch` block will handle the error and log it to the console.

## Notes

- The `writer()` function is asynchronous and returns a `Promise`. You need to use `.then()` and `.catch()` to handle the result and any errors.

- The `KMLObject` object is a JavaScript object that represents the KML data to write to the file. It should have the following properties:
  - `document` - The root `Document` element of the KML file.
  - `placemarks` - An array of `Placemark` elements in the KML file.

- The `writer()` function uses the `xml-js` library to generate the KML file. Make sure to install the library as a dependency in your project.

- The `writer()` function is not blocking the main thread, so it's safe to use it in a web application without causing performance issues.
