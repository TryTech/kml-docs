# Function reader()

The `reader()` function is used to read a KML file and return a JavaScript object.

## Syntax

```js filename="reader.js" copy
reader(filePath: string): Promise<KMLObject>
```

### Parameters

- `filePath` - The path to the KML file.

### Returns

A `Promise` that resolves with a `KMLObject` object.

## Example

```js filename="example.js" copy
import { reader } from '@trytech/kml';

reader('path/to/file.kml')
    .then((kmlObject) => {
        console.log(kmlObject);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

In the example above, the `reader()` function is used to read a KML file located at `path/to/file.kml`. The function returns a `Promise` that resolves with a `KMLObject` object. The `kmlObject` object contains the parsed KML data from the file.

If an error occurs during the reading process, the `catch` block will handle the error and log it to the console.

## Notes

- The `reader()` function is asynchronous and returns a `Promise`. You need to use `.then()` and `.catch()` to handle the result and any errors.

- The `KMLObject` object is a JavaScript object that represents the parsed KML data from the file. It contains the following properties:
  - `document` - The root `Document` element of the KML file.
  - `placemarks` - An array of `Placemark` elements in the KML file.

- The `reader()` function uses the `xml-js` library to parse the KML file. Make sure to install the library as a dependency in your project.

- The `reader()` not blocking the main thread, so it's safe to use it in a web application without causing performance issues.
