# Function validator()

The `validator()` function is used to validate a KML object.

## Syntax

```js filename="validator.js" copy
validator(kmlObject: KMLObject): boolean
```

### Parameters

- `kmlObject` - The KML object to validate.

### Returns

A `boolean` value indicating whether the KML object is valid (`true`) or not (`false`).

## Example

```js filename="example.js" copy

import { validator } from '@trytech/kml';

const kmlObject = {
    document: {
        name: 'My KML Document',
        description: 'This is a sample KML document',
        placemarks: [
            {
                name: 'Placemark 1',
                description: 'This is Placemark 1',
                point: {
                    coordinates: '10,20,0'
                }
            },
            {
                name: 'Placemark 2',
                description: 'This is Placemark 2',
                point: {
                    coordinates: '30,40,0'
                }
            }
        ]
    }
};

const isValid = validator(kmlObject);

console.log(`KML object is valid: ${isValid}`);
```

In the example above, the `validator()` function is used to validate a KML object. The `kmlObject` object contains a sample KML document with two placemarks. The function returns a `boolean` value indicating whether the KML object is valid or not.

If the KML object is valid, the `isValid` variable will be `true`. Otherwise, it will be `false`.

## Notes

- The `validator()` function checks the structure of the KML object to ensure that it conforms to the KML schema.

- The function does not perform any data validation or type checking on the values of the KML object properties. It only checks the structure of the object.

- The `validator()` function is synchronous and returns a `boolean` value. You can use it to quickly check the validity of a KML object without any additional setup.

- The `validator()` function is useful for validating KML objects before writing them to a file or sending them to a server. It can help catch errors early in the development process.

- The `validator()` function does not throw any errors if the KML object is invalid. It simply returns `false`. You can use the return value to handle validation errors in your code.

- The `validator()` function does not perform any network requests or external operations. It operates entirely on the provided KML object.

- The `validator()` function does not modify the input KML object. It only checks its structure and returns a `boolean` value.

- The `validator()` function does not validate the content of the KML object properties. It only checks the presence and structure of the properties according to the KML schema.

- The `validator()` function is a lightweight utility function that can be used in combination with other functions in the `@trytech/kml` library to build robust KML processing applications.
