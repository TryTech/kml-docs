# Function manipulator()

The `manipulator()` function is used to manipulate a KML object.

## Syntax

```js filename="manipulator.js" copy
manipulator(kmlObject: KMLObject, newPlacemark: Placemark): KMLObject
```

### Parameters

- `kmlObject` - The KML object to manipulate.

- `newPlacemark` - The new placemark to add to the KML object.

### Returns

A new KML object with the new placemark added.

## Example

```js filename="example.js" copy

import { manipulator } from '@trytech/kml';

const kmlObject = {
    document: {
        name: 'My KML Document',
        description: 'This is a sample KML document',
        placemarks: [
            {
                name: 'Placemark 1',
                description: 'This is Placemark 1',
                point: {
                    coordinates: '10,20,0'
                }
            },
            {
                name: 'Placemark 2',
                description: 'This is Placemark 2',
                point: {
                    coordinates: '30,40,0'
                }
            }
        ]
    }
};

const newPlacemark = {
    name: 'Placemark 3',
    description: 'This is Placemark 3',
    point: {
        coordinates: '50,60,0'
    }
};

const newKmlObject = manipulator(kmlObject, newPlacemark);

console.log(newKmlObject);
```

In the example above, the `manipulator()` function is used to manipulate a KML object. The `kmlObject` object contains a sample KML document with two placemarks. A new placemark is created and added to the KML object using the `newPlacemark` object. The function returns a new KML object with the new placemark added.

The `newKmlObject` variable will contain the updated KML object with the new placemark.

## Notes

- The `manipulator()` function does not modify the original KML object. It returns a new KML object with the changes applied.

- The `manipulator()` function can be used to add, update, or remove placemarks from a KML object.

- The `manipulator()` function is useful for dynamically updating KML objects in response to user interactions or other events.

- The `manipulator()` function is a powerful tool for working with KML objects in a flexible and efficient manner. It allows you to easily manipulate KML objects without having to manually modify the underlying data structure.

- The `manipulator()` function is a key part of the KML library and is used extensively in KML applications to manage and update KML objects.

- The `manipulator()` function is designed to be easy to use and understand, making it a valuable tool for developers working with KML data. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for manipulating KML objects, allowing you to focus on building great KML applications without getting bogged down in the details of the KML data format.

- The `manipulator()` function is a core part of the KML library and is actively maintained and updated to ensure compatibility with the latest KML standards and best practices.

- The `manipulator()` function is a versatile and powerful tool for working with KML data. It provides a wide range of features and capabilities for manipulating KML objects, making it an essential tool for developers working with KML data in their applications.
